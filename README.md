# Requirements:
We decided the default requirements were sufficient for the project, as we don't know what else we'd add to them.

Requirement 1 (REQUIRED) – All core Observer services should be in libcore 

Requirement 2 (REQUIRED) – Application specific portions of Observer should be in appropriate libraries (i.e. not libcore) 

Requirement 3 (REQUIRED) – Need to have a High level Session object. So application specific observers are not registered on CoreSession. 

Requirement 4 (Required) – Implement a second use case for observers to show that core functionality is isolated, but can be extensible. 

# Initial Estimate:

We believe that this project will take around 30 hours of work.

# Conclusions
//TODO

Discuss if you feel you accomplished the requirements.
Also if you give me permission to add your body of work to the GitHub project (entirely optional). 
Discuss any further extensions you feel the functionality needs.
